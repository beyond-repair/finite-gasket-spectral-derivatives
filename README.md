# Finite gasket spectral derivatives

Locked scope. This repository does not select W, does not take a continuum limit, and does not predict a force.

Parent: the discrete kernel K = omega^2 I - W L. On the finite gasket at omega = 1, lambda_max = 6, so K is positive definite if and only if W < 1/6.

Eigenvalues of K are kappa_k = 1 - W lambda_k.

    det K = product_k (1 - W lambda_k)

    Gamma_loop = (1/2) sum_k ln(1 - W lambda_k)

    d Gamma_loop / dW = (1/2) sum_k (-lambda_k) / (1 - W lambda_k)

    V''(W) = - (1/2) sum_k lambda_k^2 / (1 - W lambda_k)^2

V'' is negative wherever K is positive definite and some lambda_k is nonzero. That is concavity of the one-loop piece. It is not a vacuum and not a thrust.

## Power series

For |W| lambda_max < 1, that is |W| < 1/6,

    Gamma_loop = - (1/2) sum_{n=1}^{infty} (W^n / n) Tr(L^n).

The radius is exactly 1/lambda_max = 1/6. The series diverges at the spectral wall W = 1/lambda_max. It does not select a value of W. The half-line W < 1/6 is the positive-definiteness interval, which is larger than the disk of convergence; the truncation identity is in the next section.

S_W is not in this repository. Stationarity is not defined here.

scripts/spectral_derivatives.py evaluates the eigenvalue sums from a list of eigenvalues. It does not build W(x) and it does not emit a force.

## Truncation remainder

### Assumptions

- omega = 1 and K = I - W L, with W a prescribed scalar.
- The spectrum {lambda_k} is real and lies in [0, lambda_max] with lambda_max = 6 attained, so K is positive definite if and only if W < 1/6.
- Tr(L^n) = sum_k lambda_k^n (algebraic multiplicities). The gasket is finite, so there are finitely many eigenvalues.
- Gamma_loop(W) = (1/2) sum_k ln(1 - W lambda_k) for W < 1/6.

S_W is not an input to this identity. No value of W is selected.

### Derivation

Fix an integer N >= 0 and a real number x < 1. Define

    r_N(x) = ln(1 - x) + sum_{n=1}^{N} (x^n / n) + int_0^x t^N / (1 - t) dt.

The empty sum (N = 0) is 0. Then r_N(0) = 0. On (-infty, 1) the integrand is continuous along the segment from 0 to x, and

    r_N'(x) = -1/(1 - x) + sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x^n + x^N / (1 - x)
            = -1/(1 - x) + (1 - x^N)/(1 - x) + x^N / (1 - x)
            = 0.

Hence r_N(x) = 0 for every x < 1.

If W < 1/6, then each x_k = W lambda_k satisfies x_k < 1. Summing (1/2) r_N(x_k) = 0 is the identity in the theorem.

For the inequality, take 0 <= x < 1 and t in [0, x]. Then t^N >= 0 and

    1 <= 1/(1 - t) <= 1/(1 - x).

Integrate over [0, x]:

    x^{N+1} / (N + 1) <= int_0^x t^N / (1 - t) dt <= x^{N+1} / ((N + 1) (1 - x)).

If 0 <= W < 1/6, then 0 <= W lambda_k <= 6W < 1, so 1/(1 - W lambda_k) <= 1/(1 - 6W). Summing the resulting bounds against (1/2) and using Tr(L^{N+1}) = sum_k lambda_k^{N+1} gives the inequality below.

Radius. For lambda_k >= 0 not all zero, (sum_k lambda_k^n)^{1/n} tends to lambda_max, and n^{1/n} tends to 1, so

    limsup_{n -> infty} |Tr(L^n) / n|^{1/n} = lambda_max = 6.

The radius of sum_{n>=1} (W^n / n) Tr(L^n) is therefore exactly 1/6. For |W| > 1/6 the terms do not tend to 0. At W = 1/6 the terms are asymptotic to mult(lambda_max) / n with mult(lambda_max) >= 1, so the series diverges. At W = -1/6 the same leading piece is the alternating harmonic series, and every lambda_k < 6 contributes a series dominated by |lambda_k / 6|^n, so the series converges at that single boundary point.

### Theorem

Identity. For every integer N >= 0 and every real W < 1/6,

    Gamma_loop(W) + (1/2) sum_{n=1}^{N} (W^n / n) Tr(L^n)
        = - (1/2) sum_k int_0^{W lambda_k} t^N / (1 - t) dt.

Inequality. For every integer N >= 0 and every W in [0, 1/6),

    - W^{N+1} Tr(L^{N+1}) / (2 (N + 1) (1 - 6W))
        <= Gamma_loop(W) + (1/2) sum_{n=1}^{N} (W^n / n) Tr(L^n)
        <= - W^{N+1} Tr(L^{N+1}) / (2 (N + 1)).

The right-hand side of the identity is the exact remainder of the truncated power-trace series. The infinite series equals Gamma_loop throughout the open disk |W| < 1/6, and also at W = -1/6. It diverges for every |W| > 1/6 and at the spectral wall W = 1/6. Neither the remainder nor the radius selects W.

### Not a consequence

This section does not identify L with D - A, does not evaluate Tr(L) by a degree sum, and does not state a continuum limit, a force, or a selected W.

## Hypergeometric form of the remainder

### Assumptions

The assumptions of the truncation section stand: omega = 1, K = I - W L, W a prescribed scalar, spectrum real in [0, 6] with lambda_max = 6 attained, finitely many eigenvalues, and Gamma_loop(W) = (1/2) sum_k ln(1 - W lambda_k) for W < 1/6.

N is an integer, N >= 0. Write x_k = W lambda_k. The Gauss series and the Lerch series are

    2F1(1, N+1; N+2; z) = sum_{m=0}^{infty} (N+1)/(N+1+m) z^m,

    Phi(z, 1, N+1) = sum_{m=0}^{infty} z^m / (m + N + 1),

absolutely convergent for |z| < 1. Off the cut [1, infty) they mean the analytic continuation of those series. S_W is not an input. No value of W is selected.

The strict concavity of Gamma_loop on (-infty, 1/6), and the sign of d Gamma_loop/dW, are already recorded above from V''(W) and the first derivative. They are not restated as a theorem here.

### Derivation

Scalar series identity, classical. Let N >= 0 be an integer and let |x| < 1. On the segment from 0 to x the geometric series 1/(1-t) = sum_{m>=0} t^m converges uniformly, so

    int_0^x t^N / (1-t) dt = sum_{m=0}^{infty} int_0^x t^{N+m} dt
        = sum_{m=0}^{infty} x^{N+m+1} / (N+m+1).

The Pochhammer ratio (1)_m / m! = 1 and

    (N+1)_m / (N+2)_m = (N+1)/(N+m+1),

because (N+1)_m = (N+1)(N+2)...(N+m) and (N+2)_m = (N+2)...(N+m+1). Therefore

    2F1(1, N+1; N+2; x) = sum_{m=0}^{infty} (N+1)/(N+1+m) x^m,

and

    x^{N+1}/(N+1) * 2F1(1, N+1; N+2; x)
        = sum_{m=0}^{infty} x^{N+m+1}/(N+m+1).

The same series is x^{N+1} Phi(x, 1, N+1). Hence, for |x| < 1,

    int_0^x t^N/(1-t) dt
        = x^{N+1}/(N+1) * 2F1(1, N+1; N+2; x)
        = x^{N+1} Phi(x, 1, N+1).

The sign is positive: both sides equal -ln(1-x) when N = 0. A minus in front of the hypergeometric term would contradict the geometric series.

Endpoint x = -1. The series sum_{m>=0} (-1)^m (N+1)/(N+1+m) converges by the alternating series test. Abel's theorem gives continuity from inside the disk along the radius, and the integral is continuous on (-infty, 1), so the identity holds at x = -1.

Continuation. For z in the complex plane cut along [1, infty), the straight segment from 0 to z does not meet the cut, and

    I_N(z) = int_0^z t^N/(1-t) dt

is holomorphic there (integer N, so no branch from the power). It agrees with the hypergeometric expression on |z| < 1. By the identity theorem,

    I_N(z) = z^{N+1}/(N+1) * 2F1(1, N+1; N+2; z)
           = z^{N+1} Phi(z, 1, N+1)

on the cut plane, with 2F1 and Phi the continuations. Restricting to real x < 1 gives the integral identity on the whole positive-definiteness half-line of each eigenvalue, not only on the disk. On that half-line the continuation is also the elementary tail already proved in the truncation section,

    I_N(x) = -ln(1-x) - sum_{n=1}^{N} x^n/n
           (x < 1),

so the name 2F1 does not add a second independent formula outside the disk of the series.

Spectral step. If |W| < 1/6, then |x_k| <= 6|W| < 1 for every k, and the series form applies termwise. If W = -1/6, then x_k is in [-1, 0], the lambda_max terms sit at the convergent endpoint x = -1, and every smaller eigenvalue is inside the open disk. If W < 1/6 in general, each x_k is real and strictly less than 1, so the continued form applies; the raw power series of 2F1 at x_k need not converge when W < -1/6. Substitute the truncation identity.

### Theorem

Scalar identity, classical, applied to this spectrum. For every integer N >= 0 and every real x < 1,

    int_0^x t^N/(1-t) dt
        = x^{N+1}/(N+1) * 2F1(1, N+1; N+2; x)
        = x^{N+1} Phi(x, 1, N+1),

where the special functions are their series when |x| < 1 and at x = -1, and their analytic continuations off [1, infty) in general.

Spectral identity. For every integer N >= 0 and every real W < 1/6, with x_k = W lambda_k,

    Gamma_loop(W) + (1/2) sum_{n=1}^{N} (W^n / n) Tr(L^n)
        = - (1/2) sum_k x_k^{N+1}/(N+1) * 2F1(1, N+1; N+2; x_k)
        = - (1/2) sum_k x_k^{N+1} Phi(x_k, 1, N+1).

On |W| < 1/6 and at W = -1/6 the series may be substituted for 2F1 and Phi. For W < -1/6 the same formula uses the continuation, which equals the integral remainder already recorded. The radius of the trace series remains 1/6. Neither formula selects W.

### Numerical observation

Scalar check only, not a spectral evaluation and not a fit. For N = 0 and x = 1/2,

    int_0^{1/2} dt/(1-t) = -ln(1/2) = ln 2,

and 2F1(1, 1; 2; 1/2) = sum_{m>=0} (1/2)^m / (m+1) = -ln(1/2) / (1/2) = 2 ln 2, so (1/2) * 2F1(1, 1; 2; 1/2) = ln 2. The two sides agree exactly.

### Not a consequence

This section does not identify L with D - A, does not select W, and does not state a continuum limit, a force, a stress, or a momentum. The scalar hypergeometric identity is classical; what is recorded here is its application to the finite-gasket remainder. No claim is made that the scalar identity was previously unknown.
